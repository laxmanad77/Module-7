# Course Info Lookup Program

This is a simple Python program that allows users to retrieve information about college courses based on the course number. When a user enters a valid course number (e.g., `CSC101`), the program displays the corresponding:

- Room Number
- Instructor Name
- Meeting Time

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

The program uses three dictionaries to store information about each course:

1. **Room Numbers**
2. **Instructor Names**
3. **Meeting Times**

The user is prompted to enter a course number, and the program checks if the course exists in the dictionaries. If found, it prints all the details; otherwise, it notifies the user that the course was not found.
